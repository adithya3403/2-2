CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT(CPU):The Central Processing Unit is also called as the brain of the computer. The CPU controls the execution of programs and performs the calculations. It stores data, results and program. It controls the operation of all parts of computer.
CPU Consist of following parts and Its Functions:
a) Memory Unit.
Arithmetic and Logic Unit
Control Unit
a)Memory Unit.
Memory is an essential element of a computer. Without its memory, a computer is of hardly any use. Memory plays an important role in saving and retrieving data. The performance of the computer system depends upon the size of the memory. Memory is of following types:
Primary Memory / Volatile Memory.
Secondary Memory / Non Volatile Memory.
 


Primary Memory / Volatile Memory: Primary Memory is internal memory of the computer. RAM AND ROM both form part of primary memory. The primary memory provides main working space to the computer. The following terms comes under primary memory of a computer are discussed below:

Random Access Memory (RAM): RAM is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program and program result. It is read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence a backup uninterruptible power system(UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.

Secondary Memory / Non-Volatile Memory: Secondary memory is external and permanent in nature. The secondary memory is concerned with magnetic memory. Secondary memory can be stored on storage media like floppy disks, magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, This memory can also be stored optically on Optical disks - CD-ROM. The following terms comes under secondary memory of a computer are discussed below:

Read Only Memory (ROM): ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM, stores such instructions that are required to start a computer. This operation is referred to as bootstrap. ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.

b) Arithmetic and Logic Unit
The ALU is responsible for performing all logical and arithmetic operations Some of the arithmetic operations are as follows: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.-Some of the logical operations are as follows: comparison between numbers, letter and or special characters.- The ALU is also responsible for the following conditions: Equal-to conditions, Less-than condition and greater than condition.
c) Control Unit
It controls all other units in the computer. The control unit instructs the input unit, where to store the data after receiving it from the user. It controls the flow of data and instructions from the storage unit to ALU. It also controls the flow of results from the ALU to the storage unit. The control unit is generally referred as the central nervous system of the computer that control and synchronizes its working.
